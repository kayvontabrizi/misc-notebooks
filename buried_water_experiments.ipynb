    "# Buried Water Site-Identification Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A key component of assessing the preference for buried waters in a solvated protein-ligand simulation is identifying and unambiguously defining an \"occupancy site\" (i.e. a cavity or \"pocket\" in which internal waters may reside). While designation as a \"buried-water site\" can be qualitative and subject to questions of simulation timescale and protein flexibility, it's frequently the case that these sites are visible to the eye, and can be defined manually. Yet, they remain difficult to capture concretely by computation. The goal of this notebook is to arrive at a robust and automated method for identifying and defining buried-water occupancy sites, relying on trajectory data with thorough sampling of water-occupancy states.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparing a Toy Simulation\n",
    "I'd like everything to be easily visualizable, so let's work in 2D. Admittedly, this will lower the complexity of possible cavity arrangements, but hopefully will serve as a sufficient sandbox to attempt various approaches to the site-identification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by generating fake trajectory data. We need a complex and some solvent. We'll first make the complex trajectory, then overlay solvent frames and delete collisions, `dms-solvate` style. There are four steps to generating the complex:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Generate a hexagonal tiling of tightly-packed complex atoms\n",
    " 2. Use an SDF to draw a mask for subselecting the tiled atoms\n",
    " 3. Distort the atomic positions by integrating through a non-linear flow-field\n",
    " 4. Add random noise to these distorted positions\n",
    " 5. Randomly rotate (and possibly flip) each frame\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps allow easy control over the atomic density and cavity topology, while mimicking protein motions through non-linear transformations and random vibrations.\n",
    "We can then solvate each frame of our complex trajectories in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Generate solvent boxes by randomly placing solvent atoms, discarding any that overlap, until the desired density is reached.\n",
    " 2. For each complex frame, overlay a solvent box and discard any colliding solvent atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solvation procedure has the upside of generating a wide variety of occupancy states, a tricky-to-handle feature of real simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identifying Bulk vs Buried Solvent\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step towards defining occupancy sites, we'd like to distinguish buried solvent atoms from those in the bulk. Seeing as buried solvent atoms are isolated from the bulk, proximity-based clustering is an easy way to classify bulk vs buried. Concretely, we can compute a distance matrix for all solvent atoms, construct a per-atom graph with edges connecting pairs within some distance cutoff, and then discard large connected subgraphs (which must be patches of the bulk solvent). This approach isn't fullproof (consider that the inhabitants of bulk-exposed cavities may frequently be misclassified as bulk), but is fast, and empirically sufficient. As a refinement, we can exclude any cluster (i.e. connected subgraph) without close complex contacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: As an aside, I suspect a better way of classifying between bulk and buried is to essentially run a heat diffusion model where each atom is a cell, and at each timestep a cell's heat is computed as the average of its proximity-based neighbors' heats. By fixing the heat of protein atoms, and treating all cells with a fixed degree (# of neighbors), the steady-state heat profile should effecitvely represent the likelihood of being buried vs bulk. I've yet to test this though, it seems a bit slow. That said, there's surely plent of literature on [diffusion on a graph](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~bertram/lectures/Diffusion.pdf), maybe fast methods exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing Buried Waters across the Trajectory\n",
    "\n",
    "Having distniguished buried solvent from the bulk, we could now attempt to leverage a single frame to identify protein atoms defining a cavity, based again on proximity. However, in practice there is too much variability to reliably define a cavity from any single frame. We'd like to combine information across frames, but without a reliable global coordinate system (which nonlinear complex-atom motions make unavailable), we've no easy way to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, [recent literature offers a method of Local Alignment of Water Sites (LAWS)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.12.491708v1.full.pdf), which we can leverage to place solvent atoms identified across a trajectory into a single reference frame. In short, the algorithm is to define each solvent atom in terms of a set of distances to protein atoms, and then to best-reproduce the site by finding the position that optimally satisfies that set of distance restraints in a new reference frame. This optimization is quick and robust, and can be improved by weighting each distance restraint by its size, such that longer restraints are less important than shorter ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contact-Based Clustering and Site Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "With all our buried waters now sharing a reference frame, we're free to use our choice of geometry-based clustering methods to define our sites. As before, we can cluster by generating proximity-based graphs and isolating connected subgraphs. We set a _lower_ limit on subgraph size to strip out stragglers, and can now rely on the resultant clusters to define our occupancy sites. In particular, each cluster corresponds to a site, which we can define as the protein atoms within a small distance from any of that cluster's atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concluding Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's it! With our sites now defined in a concrete and geometry-free matter, we can moved forward with whatever occupancy analysis or site-specific binding FEP we'd like to use.\n",
    "\n",
